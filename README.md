# SupportVectorMachine
For my support vector machine work in R 

This repository stores code and datasets to help me in my understanding of Support Vector MAchines as a quadratic programming problem. 
The datasets are in .mat format, 
The functions for implemented SVM both hard and soft are in SupportVectorFunctions.r 
Running analyses using these functions are in analysis.R 
The write-up of this can be found on my wordpress site:
